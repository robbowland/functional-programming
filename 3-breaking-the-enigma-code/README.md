## Mark Breakdown

### Personal Marks

| Section                                | Mark        | Comments                                                     |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| *Correctness (from automated testing)* | ***37/40*** | - One automated test fails (**-3 marks**) [I believe this fails due to how I coded longestMenu (I think it's that one) previously, it has checks for 'cyclical' menus or similar, so if you provide a menu that is cyclical (which is rare) it won't return anything. Something like that, it's been a while since I wrote the code vs readme. ] |
| *Extension(s)*                        | ***30/30*** | -                                                            |
| *Coding style*                         | ***11/15*** | *- Use of library functions where pattern matching would be better (**-4 marks**)* |
| Documentation                          | ***15/15*** | - *Use of library functions where pattern matching would be better (**-2 marks**)* |
| -                                      | -           | ***Comments on any errors*** <br />- *One of your break enigma tests comes back with nothing and I genuinely can't work out why...*<br />***Comments on extension(s)***<br />*- Solid work!*<br />***Comments on coding style***<br />*- Avoid if then else or fst/snd where you could use patterns.<br />***Comments on documntation***<br />*- Great stuff<br />***Overall comments***<br />*- A very solid submission with very little to critique... most impressive!* |

***Overall:    93/100   |   93%***
